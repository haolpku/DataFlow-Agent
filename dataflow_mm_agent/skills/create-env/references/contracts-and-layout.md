Use installed Agent-MM contracts; never copy them into the Env package.

## Mandatory and optional surfaces

```python
class MyEnv:
    def tools(self) -> Sequence[ToolSpec]: ...
    def call(self, tool_name: str, args: Mapping[str, Any]) -> ToolResult: ...

    # Optional capabilities:
    def start(self, init: Mapping[str, Any] | None, workspace: Path) -> ToolResult | None: ...
    def close(self) -> None: ...
```

An Env can be stateful without requiring a Scenario; `start` then receives
`None`. A stateless MCP can omit `start`. Snapshots, renderers, artifact
codecs, and `verify_task` are optional domain capabilities.

### Optional capability signatures

```python
# Returns a JSON-safe mapping that StatePredicateVerifier can evaluate.
def snapshot(self) -> Mapping[str, Any]: ...

# Receives the resolved verifier binding and the finished rollout Trajectory.
# Must return VerificationResult; raise for infrastructure failures instead of
# returning failed results so ReplayVerify can mark the check diverged.
def verify_task(
    self,
    binding: Mapping[str, Any],
    rollout: Trajectory,
) -> VerificationResult: ...
```

These capabilities are discovered by `getattr`; omitting either method simply
means the corresponding verification path is unavailable for that Env.

`EnvironmentSpec` contains only stable id, name, description, solver rules,
and modalities. `ToolSpec.operation_type` is `query`, `mutation`, or `unknown`.
Use `unknown` when an upstream declaration does not prove the distinction.

## Tasks and verification

```python
Task(
    task_id="task0001",
    env_id="my_env",
    messages=(Message.text("user", "..."),),
    scenario=Scenario(init={...}),
    judge_ref=JudgeReference(
        score_min=1,
        score_max=5,
        criteria=(JudgeCriterion("accuracy", "Check the result."),),
    ),
)
```

Task is required by the runner and reusable across rollouts. Scenario is
private and optional. JudgeReference is public and optional; it defines a score
range and equally weighted task-specific criteria, while an absent value uses
the generic Judge rubric. Replay verifier factories are resolved independently
by `ReplayVerifierResolver`; they receive the live replay Env and immutable
Trajectory, and may return a graded `VerificationResult`.

## Tool and observation rules

- Use one authoritative catalog and unique stable names.
- Prefer closed, bounded JSON schemas.
- Validate semantic constraints and path confinement in the adapter.
- Return `ToolResult.failure` for expected errors.
- Keep failed multi-object mutations atomic.
- Return concise text receipts and images after relevant visual mutations.
- Do not expose shell/eval/unrestricted files or hidden truth-query tools.
- Do not implement `finish`; the runtime owns it.

Use a canonical model only when it materially improves replay, artifacts, or
rendering. External applications may stay authoritative behind an audited
session adapter.

## Registration

```python
from dataflow_mm_agent.env import register_env

def register() -> None:
    register_env(
        "my_env",
        MyEnv,
        name="My Env",
        description="Solver-facing purpose and limits.",
        modalities=("text", "image"),
    )
```

Registration never includes tasks or verifiers. Applications construct a
`JsonTaskStore` or another explicit `TaskResolver` separately.

```toml
[project.entry-points."dataflow_mm_agent.environments"]
my_env = "my_agent_mm_env:register"
```

Pin concrete MCP/browser/file dependencies in the Env distribution and test
the built wheel and sdist, including task/assets when present.

## Process-isolated deployment

For production deployments, each Env runs in a dedicated worker process via
`register_isolated_environments`. The host process never imports the Env's
dependencies directly; it discovers registered Envs through a one-shot RPC and
proxies all calls.

Environment variables that configure isolation:

| Variable | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `DATAFLOW_MM_AGENT_ENV_MODE` | `process` (isolated, default) or `inprocess` | `process` |
| `DATAFLOW_MM_AGENT_ENV_PYTHON` | Path to the Python interpreter that has the Env package installed | Auto-detected conda env |
| `DATAFLOW_MM_AGENT_ENV_NAME` | Conda env name used for auto-detection | `dataflow-mm-envs` |
| `DATAFLOW_MM_AGENT_ENV_RPC_TIMEOUT` | Seconds to wait for each worker RPC | `180` |
| `DATAFLOW_MM_AGENT_ENV_WORKER` | Internal marker set by the worker itself (`1`) | unset |

Model-routing variables (`API_URL`, `BASE_URL`, `MODEL`, `SERVING_BACKEND`,
`KIGRESS_*`) and any variable ending in a secret suffix (`*_API_KEY`,
`*_TOKEN`, `*_SECRET`, `*_PASSWORD`, `*_CREDENTIAL*`, `*_USER_KEY`) are
stripped from the worker's environment and never reach the isolated process.

```python
from dataflow_mm_agent.env.process_runtime import register_isolated_environments

register_isolated_environments(
    plugin_modules=("my_agent_mm_env",),
    project_root="/path/to/my-agent-mm-env",
)
```

The worker process must have `dataflow-mm-agent` and the Env package
installed. Keep `require_distinct=True` so every Env gets its own interpreter.
